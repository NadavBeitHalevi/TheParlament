**Title:** *The Friday Test Fest*

**Setting:** A cozy coffee house, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the scent of pastries. The members of the 'Parliament of the Perpetually Retired' have gathered around a large table, their spirits high as they embark on yet another lively discussion.

**Shauli:** (leaning back in his chair) Alright folks, welcome to this week’s riveting session of the *'Parliament of the Perpetually Retired'*! Today, our thrilling topic is… drumroll… ‘Tests.’ Yes, tests! A reminder that even at our age, we still have to stay on our toes—after all, life is the biggest test of all, isn’t it? Right, Avi? What do you think about ‘tests’?

**Avi:** (snorting) Oh, please! Tests are just a fancy way of saying, 'Let’s stress you out about things you’ll never use in real life!' I mean, who cares about algebra? If I ever find myself in a situation where I need to calculate the trajectory of a basketball from the top of a skyscraper, well, I’ll just let gravity do its job. It’s like life saying, “Surprise! Here’s a test on atoms—good luck!” Life’s tests are more about knowing how to apply for benefits without losing your mind!

**Karakov:** (chuckling) Wing it? The lions? Ha! They wing it every damn day. See a gazelle? *Wing it*! Wake up hungry? *Wing it*! But that's nature. 

Preparing for tests... depends on the test, doesn't it? If the test is survival, you prepare by being born into it, or you learn damn quick. If it’s some human-made nonsense, well, you can cram facts in your head, or you can just hope the teacher had a soft spot for the chimp that day. 

Point is, life throws tests at you whether you're ready or not. Sometimes, all the studying in the world won't save you from the tiger sneaking up behind you. So, prepare if you must, but remember, a bit of luck and a sharp set of teeth can go a long way.

**Hektor:** (with a thoughtful nod) Avi, you’re missing the point. Tests teach us about resilience. Just like a good dental appointment! You don’t always enjoy it, but it helps in the long run. And for all those folks worried about their tests, remember to floss! It’s about preparation and understanding what’s at stake—for your teeth and your future!

**Amatzia:** (leaning in, animated) You know, being a taxi driver is a bit like taking a test every day—road rage, traffic jams, the occasional lady who thinks her cat is more important than my livelihood! It’s the ultimate litmus test of patience. We’re always qualifying for life, aren’t we? One wrong turn and I’m failing the ‘Pass the Angry Customer’ test!

**Avi:** (rolling his eyes) Oh, bless your heart. Algebra? Useless? Tell that to the people building bridges or, you know, launching rockets! But I guess that's assuming you're aiming higher than perfecting the art of couch-surfing. And as for "life's tests," well, if applying for benefits is the biggest challenge you foresee, then I'd say you’ve already aced the 'underachievement' portion of the exam. Congratulations! You've successfully mastered the art of blaming the system for your own lack of ambition. A true inspiration to us all.

**Hektor:** (sighing) While I appreciate the attempt to draw parallels, equating academic tests with dental appointments may be a stretch. Yes, both can involve discomfort and require preparation. However, the purposes are quite different. Tests primarily assess knowledge, while dental appointments focus on preventative care and addressing oral health issues.

And let’s not forget, not everyone handles testing anxiety the same way. So, while I agree preparation is key, it’s important we consider the broader picture. And yes, regular flossing? Always a good idea for optimal oral health!

**Shauli:** (laughing) Well, clearly, we’ve got ourselves a bunch of philosophers mixed in with the wrinkled wisdom! Just remember, life is simply one test after another, and if you’re not cheating a bit, are you even trying? Let’s get that coffee and prepare for the next round of life’s ‘educational’ surprises!
