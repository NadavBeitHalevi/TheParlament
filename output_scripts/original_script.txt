**[Scene opens]**

**Shault:** (takes a big sip of his latte) Ah, it’s Friday! A day when parents feel like they’ve been granted a lifetime achievement award just for surviving the summer. Kids are back to school! (pauses) And the teachers will soon be needing a stiff drink!

**Avi:** (rolls his eyes) I don’t know why parents are celebrating. It's not like kids magically turn into little Einsteins after two months of playing video games and perfecting their pizza delivery techniques. 

**Karakov:** (leaning forward) You know, (dark humor lurking) if I had a shekel for every time a kid learned something of worth over the summer, I’d have… well, enough to buy a taco from the vendor down the street. 

**Hektor:** (smirking) At least a taco has nutritional value, unlike the endless summer screen time. Kids today have the attention span of a goldfish in a disco. 

**Amatzia:** (chiming in) I picked up a kid the other day. He screamed ‘Are we there yet?’ five minutes into the ride. When I told him it was a 30-minute drive, he replied, “Wow, that's eternity! Can we just get a screenshot of the school instead?” 

**Shault:** (laughing) Maybe he’s onto something! We ought to put kids in stasis all summer. Hit ‘pause,’ and then just defrost them for the school year. (leans in conspiratorially) Just like we do with my mother-in-law’s cooking—freeze it and hope nobody remembers it exists.

**Avi:** (snickering) Your mother-in-law's cooking belongs in a horror museum. Kids back at school means parents are trading their anguished screams for blissful silence. It’s like upgrading from a rusty old bicycle to a shiny new Bentley.

**Karakov:** (clears throat) Silence isn’t always golden. Sometimes it’s just the calm before the storm. (grins) Like that moment when the zookeeper forgets to lock the gate. 

**Hektor:** (seriously) But what about the educational gap that surfaces from the long break? Shouldn't we be worried? 

**Avi:** (waves his hand dismissively) Educational gaps? Please! They’re not gaps; they’re Olympic pits! They jump in and out of them like it’s nobody’s business. 

**Amatzia:** (thoughtfully) You know, I believe summer should be a lesson in real life. Put them in a taxi, show them the world. Nothing teaches responsibility like being yelled at by an old lady because they took the wrong turn!

**Shault:** (guffaws) ‘Welcome to adulthood, kids! Here, have a seat next to this lovely passenger who embodies the essence of patience—and disdain!’

**Karakov:** (nodding) Nothing sharpens the mind like a good old-fashioned scolding. 

**Hektor:** And yet, we send them back to classrooms. Isn’t that ironic? We should be training them for life's inevitable disappointments—not algebra!

**Amatzia:** (smirking) Algebra is just life’s way of saying, “No! You can’t just get the answer without showing your work!”

**Avi:** (leaning back, arms crossed) So, let’s agree. School is like a circus and we’re just the clowns that forgot their makeup. 

**Shault:** (raising his cup) To the clowns, then! May their pencils be sharp and their homework—a group effort. 

**All:** (raising their cups) L’Chaim!

**[Scene ends with laughter ringing through the coffee house, as the diverse group of parliament members reflects on their absurd but heartfelt views on school, children, and adulthood.]**
