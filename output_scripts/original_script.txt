Scene: A bustling coffee house, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the sounds of clinking cups. The parliament members are huddled around a table, looking animated as they discuss the latest calamity in the football world.

**Shault:** (Beaming, tapping his cup on the table) Alright, alright, settle down, you lot! Excellent dissection of the United-Grimsby fiasco. Honestly, I haven't seen such a self-inflicted wound since I tried to cut my own hair during lockdown. Remember that, Avi? Looked like a badger attacked my head!

**Avi:** (Chuckles, shaking his head) Oh, Shault, that was a sight. I thought you'd joined a punk band.

**Karakov:** (Dryly) More like a punk badger.

**Shault:** (Ignoring Karakov, as usual) Anyway! We've thoroughly roasted United, which, let's be honest, is a public service. But what's next on the chopping block? Anyone got a juicy topic bubbling in their caffeine-fueled brains? Hektor, you look thoughtful. Lay it on us!

**Hektor:** (Sighs dramatically) Well, I was reading about this new AI program that can write entire symphonies. Entire symphonies! What's a composer to do? It's like… it's like suddenly finding out your dog can suddenly hold a full, coherent conversation with you. At first, it's amazing. Then you realize he's only complaining about the price of kibble.

**Amatzia:** (Eyes widening) AI symphonies? So, no more needing to schlep musicians around? Next thing you know, they’ll have robot taxis, and I’ll be out of a job. I swear, I drove a fare the other day that was convinced Teslas were conspiring to put us all out of business. Said they were "silently judging" his driving!

**Avi:** (Snorts with laughter) Silently judging! That's brilliant, Amatzia. Maybe they're right. Maybe your driving *is* worth judging.

**Amatzia:** (Feigning offense) Hey! I’m a very careful driver. Except for that one time…and the other time.

**Shault:** (Cutting in, before Amatzia can derail the conversation completely) Right, right, robot uprising aside, Hektor's got a point. Are we all going to be replaced by machines? Karakov, you always have a cynical take on these things. What's your doomsday scenario?

**Karakov:** (Stirring his coffee slowly) Oh, it's simple. The robots will take over. But not in some dramatic, explosive way. They’ll just… bore us to death. Imagine an AI writing endless elevator music, but perfectly tailored to your personal preferences, until you go mad with boredom.

**Avi:** (Grimaces) That's actually terrifying.

**Hektor:** (Nods slowly) It's a valid concern. The human element, the passion, the struggle... can AI replicate that? Can a computer capture the sheer, unadulterated *angst* of a teenager writing a terrible poem about unrequited love?

**Shault:** (Grinning) Well, I've seen some pretty angsty AI-generated text. They're getting there! But let's not forget the upside. Imagine AI writing my speeches for me! Finally, someone who can make me sound profound!

**(The group exchanges amused glances.)**

**Avi:** Good luck with that, Shault. The AI might short-circuit trying to make sense of your thought process.

**Shault:** (Waving his hand dismissively) Details, details! The point is, progress is progress! So, robots writing symphonies, taxis driving themselves, what's next? Avi, you're awfully quiet. Spill! What technological terror are you pondering?

**Avi:** (Sighs) I was just thinking about deepfakes. Imagine a world where you can't trust anything you see or hear. Politicians giving speeches they never gave, celebrities endorsing products they despise... It's a recipe for complete chaos!

**Amatzia:** (Nodding) I saw a deepfake of… well, let’s just say it involved a celebrity, a rubber chicken, and a whole lot of questionable editing. I haven’t been able to look at a rubber chicken the same way since.

**Karakov:** (Quietly) The real danger is in the erosion of trust. If we can't agree on basic facts, how can we function as a society?

**Hektor:** It's like living in a permanent state of cognitive dissonance! Your brain would explode.

**Shault:** (Clapping his hands together) Alright, alright, enough doom and gloom! We're starting to sound like Karakov's autobiography! Yes, the robots might take over, yes, deepfakes might ruin everything, yes, my hair will probably never recover from that lockdown incident. But! We're here, we're caffeinated, and we're still capable of making terrible jokes! So, let's raise our cups to the future, whatever insane form it may take! And to the fact that even if robots *do* take over, they'll probably still need someone to fix the coffee machine. And that, my friends, is job security!

**(Shault raises his coffee cup, grinning, and the others join in, laughing.)**
