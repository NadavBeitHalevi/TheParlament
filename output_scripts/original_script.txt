**Setting:** A cozy coffee house on a Friday afternoon. The sunlight spills in through the windows, illuminating a group of elderly friends sitting around a table, coffee in hand, ready to tackle today’s pressing topic: soaring real estate prices.

**Shault:** (leans back confidently) Right then, let’s talk about this real estate nonsense! Prices are climbing faster than my blood pressure at a family reunion. A flat now costs more than my entire life savings! What on earth is going on?

**Avi:** (sipping his coffee) You know, my theory is simple: people are now selling their souls alongside their homes. “Buy one ghost, get a second at half price!” It's a bargain with the devil. 

**Karkov:** (chiming in, with dark humor) Ah, real estate. Where the houses may be overpriced, but at least you can always bury your hopes in the backyard. Just make sure not to dig them up!

**Hektor:** (looking serious) But truly, this is concerning. A home should be a sanctuary, not a financial jungle. Half of my patients keep asking me for advice on mortgages instead of root canals! At this rate, I’ll be prescribing interest rate relief instead of amoxicillin!

**Amatzia:** (nodding) Exactly! Everyone's looking to upsize into the “perfect” home, but they forget that a house isn’t just a roof over your head; it’s a hefty mortgage dangling like a Sword of Damocles. I pick up passengers who tell me they’ve sold their kidneys to afford a one-bedroom flat!

**Shault:** (laughs) You know it’s bad when people start considering their in-laws’ garages for extra living space. “Come visit! We’ve turned the garage into a guest suite—complete with a dust bunny buffet!”

**Avi:** (sarcastically) Yes! If you’re lucky, you might get a bathroom with a view too. Just imagine: “Ah, the scent of wild roses and the soothing sound of traffic in the background!” 

**Karkov:** (grinning) And don’t forget the charming ambiance of your neighbors arguing about the price of dog food. Truly, it’s the little things in life.

**Hektor:** (trying to steer the conversation) But we must address the impact on younger generations. They’re getting priced out! It’s harder to buy a house than it is to find decent matzah for Passover! 

**Amatzia:** (sighs) True, and let’s not forget when they finally get a house, they’re sharing it with four roommates and countless roaches. They say friendship is about sharing, but I didn't think it would come to this!

**Shault:** (snickers) With prices like these, “home sweet home” is more of a “home, sweet mortgage” kind of situation. Might as well just throw a big party and invite foreclosure—everyone loves a good shindig!

**Avi:** (tipping back in his chair) Last person standing gets to buy a coffee! A real estate lottery—now there’s an idea! “Come one, come all! Bet your life savings and spin the wheel!”

**Karkov:** (leaning forward) No one ever notices until it’s too late. Just like my first marriage—everyone was bidding, but I spent all my savings on the wrong property!

**Hektor:** (smirking) Careful, Karkov, too many mishaps like that and you’ll be forced to write your memoirs. “The House That Jack Built: A Cautionary Tale.”

**Amatzia:** (grinning) You know, at this rate, the only people who can afford a house are those who've still got the right connections. Like that one guy I picked up. He said, “I can afford it because I know the banker, the attorney, and he even offered me a cup of coffee!" 

**Shault:** (raising his coffee) A toast to connections! May our friendships be as strong as our mortgages and our hearts as light as our wallets should be.
