**SCENE START**

**INT. COFFEE SHOP - FRIDAY AFTERNOON**

Five men – SHAULI, AVI, KARKOV, HEKTOR, and AMAZIA – are gathered around a table littered with coffee cups and half-eaten pastries. The air is thick with the aroma of strong coffee and stale opinions.

**SHAULI:** (Clears throat, beaming) Right, gentlemen, settle down, settle down! Friday afternoon, the sun's shining… well, sort of… and we have before us a question of paramount importance: What do we prefer coffee, tea, espresso, or black coffee? A question that divides nations, friends, families… and possibly this very table! I, of course, am a man of refined tastes. Give me a double espresso – strong enough to wake the dead, and bitter enough to make them wish they hadn't bothered. It’s like life, really – a short, sharp shock. Anyone else feel the same?

**AVI:** (Scoffs) Espresso? You call that coffee? It’s just brown water pretending to be something important. I take black coffee, the kind that could strip paint. None of this fancy "artisanal" rubbish. Just pure, unadulterated bitterness. Like my ex-wife. Black coffee - the color of her heart!

**HEKTOR:** (Wrinkles his nose) Gentlemen, gentlemen, must we always resort to such… colorful comparisons? I, as a man of science, prefer to approach this question with reason. I find a simple cup of tea most agreeable. Earl Grey, perhaps, with a slice of lemon. Calming, civilized. Unlike the constant bickering in this group! Tea is a remedy, a medicine. You have a problem? Drink tea! You don't have a problem? Drink tea!

**AMAZIA:** Tea? Calming? Hektor, my friend, you clearly haven't spent twelve hours a day stuck in traffic with a bus up your backside. I need coffee, strong and plentiful, to keep me from driving my taxi into the nearest wall. Regular coffee for me. I take sugar, otherwise I'd be as bitter as Avi after a long day of people complaining that i'm driving too slow, or too fast!

**KARKAV:** (Quietly, after a long pause) Cyanide. In my coffee. Prevents aging.
(All stare at him)
**SHAULI:** (Laughs nervously) Karkov, always the comedian! Though I must admit, sometimes I feel like joining you. Still, we must embrace the joys of life. We should celebrate our time here together. Speaking of 'celebrating' did you guys hear about the new governmental plan to implement higher taxes? I will need to drink more coffee after that, or maybe move to another country...

**AVI:** (Eyes gleaming) Taxes? Don't even get me started! The government is 'drinking' our blood, there's no money left!

**HEKTOR:** Avi, please. Calm down. We must approach this issue with a degree of rationality. Taxes are a necessity to fund essential public services. But I agree they should be implemented fairly. I am still trying to understand how the government is going to fix the system. Maybe some tea can help me think.

**AMAZIA:** Let me tell you something. The taxes are killing people slowly - "killing with honey" I see people giving up!
I wish i could give them something that can help them, but what can i do? I'm just a taxi driver...

**KARKAV:** Government… like zoo. Feed the animals, some survive, some don't.
(He sips his coffee and stares into the distance)

**SHAULI:** (Claps his hands together) Alright, alright! Let's not descend into political madness. We are just at the beginning. The idea is to talk about coffee, tea, espresso or black coffee? Any thoughts?

**AVI:** My thought is that coffee is the only thing that keeps me going when I am still looking for work!

**HEKTOR:** You can always drink more tea!

**AMAZIA:** Maybe you should try driving a taxi, you will never get bored!

**KARKAV:** Boredom… like cage.

**SHAULI:** So let me see. We spoke about black coffee, espresso, tea and regular coffee. In conclusion, we didn't reach any conclusion!
