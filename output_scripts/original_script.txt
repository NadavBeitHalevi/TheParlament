**Scene: A quaint coffee house buzzing with the chatter of old friends reunited for their weekly debate. Five elderly members sit around a table, nursing their coffees and trading quips. The sun casts a warm glow through the windows, illuminating their spirited conversation.**

**Shault:** (grinning) So, chaps, today’s topic is trouble at work. High tech companies? Sounds like a recipe for disaster! It's like handing your grandmother a smartphone and telling her to do the banking. 

**Avi:** (sipping his coffee) Or like letting me manage the company’s budget. You’d think I was trying to finance a moon landing instead! (leans in dramatically) Have you seen the prices for tupperware? 

**Karakov:** (raising an eyebrow) Let’s be honest, Avi. The real trouble starts when they ask you to work from home. Last I checked, my pet goldfish wasn’t getting a good salary, but somehow, he gets a front-row seat to my panic attacks. 

**Hektor:** (chuckling) Well, it’s about being productive, isn’t it? I had a patient the other day, told him I work in high tech. Thought he needed a root canal; turns out he just had a serious fear of algorithms. 

**Amatzia:** (nodding) I see it every day, folks. I pull up to drop someone off at a tech firm and you can smell the desperation. People are staring at their phones like they’re about to perform surgery! It’s like watching someone try to revive a raisin. 

**Shault:** (laughs heartily) Ah, yes! If the techies don’t find the solution, they’ll just reboot. You know, like we do after a long Friday. (winks)

**Karakov:** (deadpan) Or like I do to my toaster when it doesn’t burn bread properly. 

**Avi:** (sarcastic) Yeah, because nothing says ‘successful work environment’ like burnt toast. Let’s be real; half the people in these companies just want a place to charge their phones and complain about their lives. 

**Hektor:** (leaning in) And the other half? They’re busy trying to figure out how to use their coffee machine! I worked with this guy who set it to ‘espresso’ and ended up with... (pauses dramatically) brown paint! 

**Amatzia:** (grinning) Sounds like my taxi! I had a rider once who mistook my car for a mobile office. He settled in like it was a five-star hotel. By the end, I was convinced I was in a conference call about how to not get fired from life! 

**Shault:** (giggling) You know, they say if you don't like your work, make it look glamorous! If I spruced up my old briefcase with glitter, I might just land a job! But I’d need a warning label: “Open at your own risk; contents may cause existential dread.” 

**Karakov:** (nodding) Ah, the classic existential crisis. I’d say it’s like a bad marriage... you just can’t seem to get out, and the drama gets thicker every day!

**Avi:** (feigning shock) Did someone say marriage? I thought we were talking about work! But then again, my last office job felt just like dating – I spent half my time pretending to be interested. 

**Hektor:** (laughing) Right? The only thing worse than your boss’s endless Zoom calls is the awkward silence after every “Can you hear me?” 

**Amatzia:** (chiming in) And let’s not forget the “Can you see my screen?” That lovely moment when you realize you’ve been sharing your cat videos instead of the quarterly report. 

**Shault:** (taking a sip) Perhaps the key to happiness in high tech is just to accept that you’re not a real adult anymore. We’re all just high-functioning toddlers, playing with our gadgets. 

**Karakov:** (nods) And hoping that someone doesn’t get hurt in the playroom.

*The group erupts into laughter, savoring both the camaraderie and the wisdom shared, as they clink their coffee cups to the absurdity and reality of working in high tech.*

*Scene fades out as they continue to banter about successes, failures, and the shared joys of surviving another week.*
